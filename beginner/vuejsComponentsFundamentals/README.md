Web components are custom developer defined HTML elements, like `<p>`,`<body>`, or `<button>`, that allows us to encapsulate some functionality of our applications.

This course covers the fundamental and important concept of Vue.js components.

Components are the puzzle pieces of a Vue.js website. Components combine blocks of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. And as a result, they allow us to easily encapsulate and reuse functionality in our applications.

**After this course, you'll be familiar with:**
- The idea behind components and how Vue.js components work

- Communication between components with props and custom events
- What is the true difference between global and local component registration
- The lifecycle hooks of a component
- Component composition with nested components and slots
- Component's best practices and common pitfalls

We've also prepared exercises for the course, so you can practice what you learn.
